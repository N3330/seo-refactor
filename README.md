## Description
Took a working webpage and optimzed it for better accessibility and search engine optimization. I changed the index.html to utilize semantic HTML elements and no divs and made sure it follows a logical structure. Compressed images for faster loading using optimizilla, and added alt text to all images. Changed CSS to reflect changes in the HTML elements and conlidated repetitive code using classes. Added comments to explain some of the changes.
